Core Concept: "Strangers: After Hours" - A Party Game for Building Connections

This is a prompt-based game designed to be played in person, at social gatherings, with the primary goal of fostering deeper connections and encouraging vulnerable self-expression among relative strangers. The app acts as a facilitator for in-person social interactions, not as a standalone digital experience.

Target Audience: Individuals attending social gatherings (parties, meetups, etc.) who are open to meeting new people and engaging in meaningful conversations, ranging from lighthearted to potentially deep and revealing.

Core Gameplay Loop (Physical Interaction Driven):

App Host Designation: A single person (or designated player) controls the app on their phone. The app is primarily a way to access the prompts, not for individual participation or tracking.

Level & Intensity Selection (Group Decision):

The group collectively decides on a starting Level:

Level 1: Icebreakers: Lighthearted, general interest prompts to ease people into conversation.

Level 2: Getting to Know You: Explores shared experiences, interests, and aspirations.

Level 3: Deeper Dive: Examines values, beliefs, and personal philosophies.

The app presents the Intensity Level options:

Intensity 1: Mild: Family-friendly, generally safe and non-controversial.

Intensity 2: Medium: Encourages vulnerability and self-reflection, but avoids highly sensitive topics.

Intensity 3: Wild: Explores potentially sensitive, controversial, or deeply personal subjects (with strong disclaimers and safeguards).

The group votes or agrees on the Intensity Level.

Prompt Display (App Host): The App Host displays a randomly selected prompt on their phone screen.

Verbal Sharing (All Players): Players take turns answering the prompt verbally within the group. This is the core of the game â€“ the in-person sharing and discussion.

Optional Challenges (Social Interaction):

After someone answers, other players have the option to issue a Challenge. These challenges are designed to be lighthearted and fun, tailored to a physical social setting. Examples include:

Truth or Dare: The group chooses a truth or dare for the player to perform.

Act-Out: The player has to act out something related to their answer.

The answering player can choose to:

Accept the Challenge

Pass (and face a pre-agreed upon consequence that will be decided by the game or other players)

Consequence Alternation The default choice for a challenge is to take a sip of an alcoholic beverage, but that default setting is only chosen with consent as it will affect the dynamic of the game.

Group Discussion: The group engages in further discussion based on the answers and challenges, building on each other's responses.

Progression Vote (App Host or Designated Player):

The App Host (or another designated player) decides whether to increase the intensity level for the next round, but only with the consent of the game.

Level change has to be voted on

Loop Repeat: Steps 3-8 are repeated, with the phone passed around the circle or a new App Host chosen.

Key Features & Design Considerations:

Emphasis on Verbal Communication: The app should facilitate and encourage in-person conversation, not replace it.

Limited App Functionality: The app's primary function is to randomly select and display prompts and present challenges. Keep it simple.

Clear Visual Hierarchy: The app should have a clean and intuitive user interface, with clear visual cues to guide users through the gameplay loop.

Prominent Disclaimers: The app must display clear and prominent disclaimers about the potentially sensitive nature of the prompts, especially at higher Intensity Levels.

Customization (Optional): Consider allowing App Hosts to add their own custom prompts or challenges to personalize the game.

Physical Setting Focus: Remember that the game is designed for a physical setting. Don't rely on features that require individual screens or constant app interaction.
